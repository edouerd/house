House

—

I saw [this](https://github.com/canadaduane/house) beautiful repository and decided to blatantly steal the format. It isn't forked because we have our own seperate houses. I also figured this would make an excellent staging area for my [Mornings](https://github.com/mornings-co) 'Interventions' project I hope to host here in a similar fashion.
